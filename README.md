# Research for BA
Facial Recognition in Policing

## Getting Started
Make sure you have jupter notebook [installed](https://jupyter.org/install)

Make sure you have the [dataset](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present-Dashboard/5cd6-ry5g) installed locally in the same repo. Note that the original dataset is massive so make sure to export after filtering the data to the years you want (for testing, I filtered to just 2019 data). 

Run `jupter notebook project.ipynb`

Go to `http://localhost:8888/notebooks/project.ipynb`

If you're using virtual environment: `pip install notebook`

You might also need to `pip install -U scikit-learn scipy matplotlib`
